## Hot Code Reload demo

## Getting Started

1. Clone starter kit locally.

  ```
  git clone https://github.com/sysgears/apollo-fullstack-starter-kit.git
  cd apollo-fullstack-starter-kit
  ```

2. Install dependencies.

  ```
  npm i
  ```
  or 
  ```
  yarn
  ```

3. Seed sample database data.

  ```
  npm run seed
  ```
  or
  ```
  yarn seed
  ```

4. Run starter kit in development mode.

  ```
  npm watch
  ```
  or
  ```
  yarn watch
  ```

6. Point your browser to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
7. Change any app code and see the changes applied immediately!
8. Open app in multiple tabs, try to increase counter in one tab and then switch to another tab. You will see that 
counter value updated there as well, because counter is live updated via subscriptions.

## Deployment to Production

### Deploying to Linux running Node.js
1. Clone starter kit locally.

  ```
  git clone https://github.com/sysgears/apollo-fullstack-starter-kit.git
  cd apollo-fullstack-starter-kit
  ```

2. Install dependencies.

  ```
  npm i
  ```
  or 
  ```
  yarn
  ```
3. Seed production database data.

  ```
  npm run seed --prod
  ```
  or
  ```
  NODE_ENV=production yarn seed
  ```

5. Compile project.

  ```
  npm run build
  ```
  or 
  ```
  yarn build
  ```
  
6. Run project in production mode.

  ```
  node build/server
  ```
  or
  ```
  npm start
  ```
  or
  ```
  yarn start
  ```
  
### Deploying to [Heroku]
1. Add your app to Heroku
1. Allow Heroku to install build time dependencies from the devDependencies in package.json:
   `Settings -> Config Variables -> Add`, KEY: `NPM_CONFIG_PRODUCTION`, VALUE: `false`.
1. Deploy your app on Heroku

## Heroku Demo 
You can see latest version of this app deployed to Heroku here:

## Features
- [Webpack] for backend

  This starter kit is different from most of the starter kits out there, because it uses Webpack not only for frontend,
but for backend code as well. This enables powerful Webpack features for backend code, such as conditional compilation, 
embedding non-js files and CSS stylesheets into the code, hot code reload, etc.

- Hot Code Reload for backend and frontend
  
  Hot Code Reload for backend is done using [Webpack]. When Webpack prepares hot patches on the filesystem,
SIGUSR2 signal is sent to Node.js app and embedded Webpack Hot Module Runtime reacts to this signal and 
applies patches to running modules from filesystem. Hot code reload for frontend is using Webpack Dev Server
and Hot Module Replacement to apply patches to frontend code. Hot patches for React components are applied on the 
frontend and backend at the same time, so React should not complain about differences in client and server code.

- Webpack DLL vendor bundle generation and updating out of the box

  For all the non-development dependencies of project `package.json` the [Webpack] vendor DLL bundle is generated 
  and updated automatically, so that Webpack didn't process vendor libraries on each change to the project, but only
  when they are actually changed. This boosts speed of cold project start in development mode and speed of hot code reload
  even if the number of dependencies is huge.

- Server Side Rendering with Apollo Redux Store sync

  On the initial web page request backend fully renders UI and hands off Apollo Redux Store state to frontend. Frontend
then starts off from there and updates itself on user interactions.

  If you don't need Server Side Rendering, set package.json `ssr` field to `false`

- Optimistic UI updates

  This example application uses Apollo optimistic UI updates, that result in immediate UI update on user interaction and then, 
after data arrives from the server, UI state is finalized.

- [GraphQL] API

  GraphQL is used as very flexible and much faster API in terms of bandwidth and round-trips, compared to REST. 
GraphQL requests are batched together automatically by [Apollo]

- [GraphQL] subscription example
  
  GraphQL subscription is utilized to make counter updating in real-time.

- SQL and arbitrary data sources support

  [Knex] code to access SQLite is included as an example of using arbitrary data source with [Apollo] and [GraphQL]. 
NoSQL storage or any other data source can be used the same way.

- Powerful stylesheets with Hot Reloading

  [Twitter Bootstrap] in form of SASS stylesheets is used for styling demo application. Application has stylesheet
in `styles.scss` for global styling which is Hot Reloaded on change. React components styling is done by [Aphrodite CSS].` 

- [Babel] for ES2017 transpiling

- [ESLint] to enforce proper code style
